* Checkout Times for Users
    * Here we see all groups decrease as they are most 
ikely using public or private transit later in the day. We see female riders are lower during early mornings in NYC, could be because of having a family and having to transport them to day care or school. We also see male riders are greater during early mornings in NYC, could be due to traffic during their work commute. We see all groups decrease as they are most likely using public or private transit later in the day.

# Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

In the analysis of CitiBike Rentals in NYC shows that weekends tend to be less active compared to the weekdays for Male Subscribers. A customer based platform may not give the best insight but a subscriber based one may be better. Des Moines in comparison to NYC can be completely missleading being that the population in NYC maybe greater, to point out the heavy traffic flow in NYC. This analysis shows that this program if possible should be treated as a piolet to see how well it actually does in this location.

With the given dataset I would provide a visual of the average age of the bike rider to assit with knowing which demographic works better in making the determination of which group is more willing to ride a bike.
Visuals on the cost of repair and investments this will assis on making a better business decision with the start of this business. I strongly recommend a data comparison to see what the costs are for NYC and if they are profitting in NYC if they are not brining in revenue with a greater population it would not be a good ideal for a smaller population to take on this project.
